    Yes,
    By using quick search we don't need to iterate all over the array
    If there is a lead number it must be in the middle number of the array,
    Because the array is sorted and the amount of the lead number is bigger then half of the array length.
    We just need find the start and the end index of the lead number via quick search to get the amount of the lead number
    And then to check if its bigger then half of the array length
